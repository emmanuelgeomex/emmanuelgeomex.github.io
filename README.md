# BIO
<p align="justify"> I am a geohazard scientist with expertise in designing and implementing research projects to assess the spatial and temporal dimensions of extreme events. My approach relies on geological and geomorphological investigations, geospatial methods, statistical modeling, and data visualization to assess the impacts and recurrence of climate and geological hazards. I focus on providing actionable insights that support adaptation and mitigation strategies, helping communities reduce risk and enhance resilience in the face of evolving environmental challenges.
